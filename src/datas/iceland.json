    "text": "In our bucket list, one of the top country in our list was Iceland. So in February, we've decided to book a flight from Brussels to Reykjavik to realize our dream. During our landing, the windstorm was so violent that the pilot tried to land twice before succeeded. Eventually, we arrived safe and sound in Keflavik where we rent a car for a week. Then a trip of 800km across multiples cities  started, through beaches, waterfalls, mountains or volcans. We were most of time alone, but it was so nice. We can't wait to go back there again: Iceland is definetly the place to visit.",
