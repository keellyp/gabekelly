    "text": "In April 2017, we tooked the bus from France to Croatia with some of our friends. After 20 hours of trip and a lack of sleep, we ended up in the middle of this super nice city: Zagreb. We spent our week at Chillout Hostel which was very well located. The cost of living was very low compared to Paris which has allowed us to visit the city and enjoy it as students. We've also rent a car and had driven to Plitvice Lakes National Park. It was one of the most beautiful place for nature and waterfalls we had ever seen and we greatly recommend it.",
