    "text": "From July to October 2018, Kelly did her 3rd grade internship in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We had to chance to see each other multiple times during these months. It was a new experience to live somewhere else than Paris for some times. We definetly enjoyed it for the calm, the kindness of Dutch people and their quality of life. Fortunately, the weather was quite good during this summer (for the first time since a long time) so we enjoyed a lot biking and wandered along the canals.",
