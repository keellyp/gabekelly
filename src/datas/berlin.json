    "text": "As Gabriel birthday is between Christmas time and New Year's Eve, we couldn't see each other a lot, so what's better than a quick trip to take some time for us? We always wanted to visit Berlin together: its vibes, history and kind of darkness make this city very attractive and so to mark the occasion, we booked a very atypic AirBnb: a boat. What a wonderful experience! The boat has been built by a couple of artists. They built it from scratch and from time to time, they like to rent it when they are abroad for work. Anyway, this place was magical and during a week, our time stopped.",
